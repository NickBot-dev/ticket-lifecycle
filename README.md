</p>
<p>
Ticket Assignment and Communication. This ticket was assigned to myself and I responded with an update to the emergency after further investigation. Also, assuring the customer that I am working on it diligently. The second comment posted was my final solution for resolving the ticket. Being polite and empathetic with customers through good communication is a must.

</p>
<p>
After a ticket has been resolved, you would edit the status of the ticket, changing the status to resolved. Previously resolved tickets will remain accessible to view under the closed tab.

</p>
<p>
Creating Tickets as an End User. The customer would first access the organization's localhost page where customers/end users can create and submit their own tickets. This allows greater proficientcy for the submission of new tickets.
