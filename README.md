Observing Ticket Properties. Ticket Properites consist of Status, Priority, Department, Service Level Agreement (SLA), & whom the ticket is assigned to.

<p>
Ticket Assignment and Communication. This ticket was assigned to myself and the Online Bankng team. I responded with an update to the emergency after further investigation. Also, assuring the customer that I am working on it diligently. The second comment posted was my final solution for resolving the ticket. Being polite and empathetic with customers through good communication is important.

After a ticket has been resolved, you would edit the status of the ticket, changing the status to resolved. Previously resolved tickets will remain accessible to view under the closed tab.

Creating Tickets as an End User. The customer would first access the organization's localhost URL page where customers/end users can create and submit their own tickets. This allows greater proficientcy for the submission of new tickets.
